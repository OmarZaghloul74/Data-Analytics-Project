# Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Data Analytics Project
Project Overview
This project explores customer churn in the telecommunications industry using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to identify key factors contributing to customer churn. The insights derived can help businesses develop strategies to improve customer retention.

Key Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and handled missing values.
Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., customer ID).
Converted categorical variables to appropriate data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used visualizations to understand feature distributions.
Investigated correlations between variables.
Examined churn patterns across different customer segments.
Feature Engineering:

Processed numerical and categorical features for model training.
Created new relevant features where necessary.
Modeling & Prediction:

Applied machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualizations
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains customer demographic and service details. The target variable is "Churn", which indicates whether a customer has left the service.
